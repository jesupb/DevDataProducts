## So what's the Body Mass Index?

- The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a way to quantify the amount of tissue mass in your body, and it let's you know if you can be considered to be anywhere from underweight to obese.  

- Usually you'd want to be around the **normal** range, which goes from 18.5kg/m2 to 25kg/m2, although you could be outside this range and still be considered healthy.
  - There's no such thing as a one-measure-fits-all!

## OK, now I'm all thrilled about knowing my BMI! How do I calculate it?

- The calculation of the BMI is as <span title="It is kg/m2" style="color:red">complicated</span> as it can get, but _fear not_, because there's [this](https://jesupb.shinyapps.io/BMI_Calculator/) awesome app that'll do the calculation for you!

- You can try it right here!

## What's going on in the calculator?

If you are the nerdy kind of person, and really _really_ want to know what's going on inside the calculator, I'll leave this code chunk here for you to check:

```{r}
my_height <- 1.75 # in meters
my_weight <- 75  # in kg
my_bmi <- my_weight/my_height^2
my_bmi
```

As I said before, as complicated as it gets.

Thanks for checking out my project :)
